### These are my personally created bash related files.
<hr>

<h4>Here I have used 2 files named <i><b>alias</b></i> and <i><b>functions</b></i>. In the alias file, I have added all the keyboard shortcuts used in the bash.</h4>

#### In the `.bashrc` file, I have sourced the other files, so that all the functions and alias can work. And after that I have put these 3 files inside a `.bash` directory in the `$HOME` directory. And then, I have created a link of the `.bashrc` file in the `$HOME` directory, so that it can run properly.
